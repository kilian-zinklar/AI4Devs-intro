The prompt:

----------------

Create a web page with JavaScript logic that reverses the order of a string. Example: if I input AI4Devs, it should return sveD4IA.

The project will be done in Javascript, html & css. Use a separate js file.

The project should have an input for the user to write the text. A button that will run the reverse string logic And an output of the reversed string.
Use a modern dark interface, make it responsive and make sure it covers the a11y standards.

If there is something that is not clear, ask it before generating code.
