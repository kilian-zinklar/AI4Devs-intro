ChatGPT 4o:

You are an expert frontend developer in html and vanilla javascript. Create a web application that will have a centered title "Inversor de texto", with a form just below with a text input to the left with placeholder "Introduce un texto" and a blue button to the right with text "Invertir" And just below it a Label "Texto invertido: " that will have a concatenated text in green that will start being blank. Make it responsive.

This page will work inverting the text inputted with the button and setting it in the green text just below. Generate a single html file called index.html and a single javascript file called script.js
