"Hi, you are a senior expert frontend developer, today we are going to build a new feature using Semantic HTML with accesibility tags, and Vanilla Javascript

We need to build an interface that allow the user to input any string on the input field and then when the users clicks the Invert button we will apply the reverse to the string that the users insert.

Some tasks:

Create a layout for the feature, with a box white with some light shadow
Add some light gray background color, like #fefefe , on the body tag.
Use Google Font: Roboto 500 
Add an h1, that says: Invertir cadena de texto.
Add an input for the user to write any String chain.
Add a Invertir Texto button that triggers the invertText function
Add an <h2> with blue color to show the inverted text after the sentence: Texto invertido:

Add some metatags and descriptions to have a complete well formed HTML to index. 

We need to use tailwind and create a user friendly, with UX experience, responsive design and light blue and white colors, like the Argentinian Flag. Lets create a well performance code.

Lets get Started."
